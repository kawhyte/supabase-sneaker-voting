/**
 * âœ… ADD PRODUCT CLIENT - DESIGN SYSTEM v2.0 IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 * ðŸŽ¯ DESIGN STRATEGY:
 *
 * **Component Purpose:**
 * Client-side wrapper component for adding new products to the tracking system.
 * Acts as a thin interface between the product add page and the reusable AddItemForm component.
 * Handles product-specific callbacks and initialization.
 *
 * **Architecture:**
 * - 'use client' directive: Enables client-side interactivity (React Hook Form, state management)
 * - Delegates rendering to AddItemForm: No duplicate styling logic
 * - Thin wrapper pattern: Maintains separation of concerns
 * - Reusable across product and item contexts
 *
 * **Integration:**
 * - Parent: @/app/dashboard/add-product/page.tsx (server component)
 * - Child: AddItemForm (client component, form implementation)
 * - Callback: handleProductAdded() fires on successful form submission
 *
 * **Styling & Layout:**
 * - No styling applied here (inherited from parent page + AddItemForm)
 * - Page container: bg-background (blaze-50), responsive padding, max-width constraint
 * - Form container: AddItemForm handles all styling with design system v2.0 tokens
 * - Ensures consistent layout across product and item add flows
 *
 * **State Management:**
 * - Minimal state: Only tracks form submission callback
 * - AddItemForm handles: photos, prices, sizing, try-on metadata
 * - Router navigation: Handled by AddItemForm after successful submission
 *
 * **Accessibility (WCAG AAA):**
 * - Client-side interactivity: Smooth form transitions, error handling
 * - Semantic HTML: Delegated to AddItemForm and shadcn/ui components
 * - Keyboard navigation: Full support via form libraries
 *
 * **Performance:**
 * - Minimal re-renders: Thin wrapper with single callback
 * - Lazy loaded: Only initializes on page render
 * - Reuses AddItemForm optimization (React Hook Form, Zod)
 *
 * **Future Scalability:**
 * - Can add product-specific logic without modifying AddItemForm
 * - Support for product templates or pre-filled data
 * - Easy to extend with additional callbacks (analytics, webhooks, etc.)
 * - Pattern can be replicated for other item types
 *
 * ðŸ“š Related: add-product/page.tsx (server component), add-item-form.tsx (form implementation)
