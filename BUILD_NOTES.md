# Build and Permission Issues Resolution

## Issue Encountered
- EACCES permission denied errors when trying to build
- .next directory owned by root user
- Unable to remove or rebuild cleanly

## Root Cause
The .next directory was created by a process running as root (possibly during development or deployment), making it inaccessible to regular user operations.

## Resolution Options

### Option 1: Manual Permission Fix (Recommended)
Run the following commands to fix permissions:

```bash
# Fix ownership of .next directory
sudo chown -R $(whoami) .next

# Remove and rebuild
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```

### Option 2: Clean Development Environment
If permission fix doesn't work:

```bash
# Create fresh node_modules and build
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .next
npm install
npm run build
```

### Option 3: Use Docker (if issues persist)
For a completely isolated build environment:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app -w /app node:18 sh -c "npm install && npm run build"
```

## Prevention
To avoid this issue in the future:
1. Always use the same user for development and build processes
2. Avoid running development commands with sudo
3. Use proper container setup for deployment

## Current Status
- Documentation and migration files have been successfully created
- Supabase integration is properly configured
- Application is ready for deployment once build issues are resolved

## Verification Commands
After fixing permissions, verify everything works:

```bash
npm run build    # Should complete without errors
npm run dev      # Should start development server
npm run start    # Should start production server (after build)
```
